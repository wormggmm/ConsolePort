<h2>What is ConsolePort?</h2>
ConsolePort is an interface add-on for *** that will give you a handful of nifty features
in order to let you play the game on a controller - without inconvenience.
<br/><br/>
Consisting of several independent modules, ConsolePort is a fully-fledged solution to handling all the quirks in a game where gamepad support was not intended,
including interface navigation, custom-tailored UI elements to assist in gameplay, and easy-to-use targeting systems
for end-game content. As of Shadowlands, ConsolePort uses native gamepad controls. No external software is required.
